    "There seems to be some inherent bias of the categories just by the structure of the Wikispeedia network. Indeed, it seems much more likely to end up in World Regions or Science just because the categories are much bigger and more links lead to it. Maybe there is a way of disentangling the user behaviour from the network structure? If we consider that users only click on links randomly (i.e. a random walk in the Wikispeedia Network), we can capture the effect of the network structure. Indeed, if taking a random walk always leads you to World Regions, then maybe the users do not actually choose to go there but the network structure just makes it very likely that they end there anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model this, Markov chains come in handy: we can model the transition probabilities from one article A to an article B just by counting the number of links to article B in article A, and dividing by the number of links there are on the page in total. While this does not eliminate all bias (for instance, links further up in the page may be clicked more), this Markov chain still gives valuable insight about the network structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an equivalent transition matrix for users, we can simply count the transitions users actually made at each step. To compare the two obtained probability distributions, we will use the Kullback–Leibler ($KL$) divergence, a type of statistical distance measuring how much a model probability distribution $Q$ (the random probabilities) differ from a probability distribution $P$ (our users' transitions).
