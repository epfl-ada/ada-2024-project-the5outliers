Maybe there is a way of disentangling the user behaviour from the network structure? If we consider that users only click on links randomly (i.e. a random walk in the Wikispeedia Network), we can capture the effect of the network structure. Indeed, if taking a random walk always leads you to World Regions, then maybe the users do not actually choose to go there but the network structure just makes it very likely that they end there anyway.\n",

Furthermore, we compute the interval as $1.96$ times the standard error, which we compute in the same fashion as the mean for each path position. We also normalise the scale to $[0, 1]$, as the similarity scores for the two models are in a different, somewhat arbitrary, range.
