If we consider that users only click on links randomly (i.e. a random walk in the Wikispeedia Network), we can capture the effect of the network structure.

Furthermore, we compute the interval as $1.96$ times the standard error, which we compute in the same fashion as the mean for each path position. We also normalise the scale to $[0, 1]$, as the similarity scores for the two models are in a different, somewhat arbitrary, range.
